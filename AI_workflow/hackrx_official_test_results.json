    "answers": [
      "Unfortunately, the provided text does not mention the grace period for premium payment under the National Parivar Mediclaim Plus Policy. It only mentions the 7-day notice period for policy cancellation.",
      "The waiting period for pre-existing diseases (PED) to be covered is 3 years. After 3 years of continuous cover, the following conditions will be covered: joint replacement (unless due to an accident), osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, morbid obesity, and its complications.",
      "The policy covers maternity expenses, specifically \"Medical treatment expenses traceable to childbirth (including complicated deliveries and caesarean sections)\". However, the newborn baby is only covered if specifically included in the policy mid-term and the requisite premium is paid.",
      "The waiting period for cataract surgery is 30 days. This is mentioned in the policy text as \"30 days\" under the \"Post Hospitalisation\" section.",
      "Based on the policy text, it appears that medical expenses for an organ donor are not explicitly mentioned. However, since the exclusion mentions \"Pre-hospitalization Medical Expenses\" and organ donation is typically a pre-hospitalization procedure, it's likely that medical expenses for an organ donor are excluded from coverage.",
      "The No Claim Discount (NCD) offered in this policy is a flat 5% on the base premium, provided no claims are reported on renewal of a one-year policy.",
      "Yes, there are benefits to preventive health check-ups. Regular check-ups can help detect health issues early, allowing for timely treatment and potentially preventing more severe problems. This can also reduce healthcare costs in the long run.",
      "The policy defines a 'Hospital' as any institution established for in-patient care and day care treatment of disease/injuries, which has been registered as a hospital with the local authorities under the Clinical Establishments Act.",
      "The policy text does not explicitly mention the extent of coverage for AYUSH treatments. However, it defines AYUSH Treatment (2.6) and AYUSH Hospital (2.7), indicating that the policy may cover treatments provided by these facilities, but further details on coverage extent are not provided.",
      "Unfortunately, the provided policy text does not mention any sub-limits on room rent and ICU charges for Plan A. It only mentions the general limit for room charges and intensive care unit charges per day."
