Sample Document for Processing
=============================

This is a sample text document that demonstrates the document 
processing system's capabilities.

Key Features:
• Intelligent document type detection
• Multi-format support (PDF, DOCX, emails, images)
• OCR capabilities for image-based content
• Metadata extraction and confidence scoring
• Batch processing capabilities

The system can process various document types and extract
meaningful content for further analysis or indexing.

Processing Pipeline:
1. File type detection using MIME types and signatures
2. Route to appropriate parser based on detected type
3. Extract text content using specialized tools
4. Apply OCR if needed for image-based documents
5. Return structured results with metadata

This approach ensures optimal processing for each document type
while maintaining high accuracy and performance.
