{"answers":["Newton defines the quantity of motion as the measure of the same, arising from the velocity and quantity of matter conjunctly. This means that the quantity of motion is a product of both the velocity of an object and its mass","Newton's method of fluxions is a mathematical technique used to study rates of change and slopes of curves. It is essentially a precursor to the modern concept of calculus, particularly differential calculus. In essence, the method of fluxions","Newton derives Kepler's Second Law from his gravitational theory by considering the motion of a planet acted upon by an attractive force varying inversely as the squares of the distances. According to Newton's theory, the planet will describe an ellipt","Newton's three laws of motion are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, based on general knowledge, Newton's three laws of motion are:\n\n1. The First Law (Law of Inertia): An object at rest","Newton's concept of absolute space is that it is an unchanging, immovable dimension that exists independently of the motion of objects within it. In contrast, relative motion refers to the motion of objects with respect to each other or","Newton uses the last Theorem and Cor 4 of the Laws of Motion to determine the motions of the two bodies. He then applies the method described in Problem XXV to find the motions of the bodies as if they were","Newton explains that the tides are caused by the gravitational force of the moon on the Earth's oceans. He states that the moon's force to move the sea is to the force of gravity as 1 to 287,","Newton explains the precession of the equinoxes as a result of the combined forces of the sun and the moon. He states that the force of the moon to move the sea is nearly as 4,4815 to","Newton's treatment of comets demonstrates universal gravitation by showing that they, like other celestial bodies, are subject to the same gravitational forces. He argues that comets, being composed of matter, must be affected by the gravitational","Newton's explanation for the Earth's oblate spheroid shape is based on the concept of a sphere being transformed into a spheroid due to its diameter being diminished in a certain proportion. According to Newton, if a","Robert Newton was the grandfather of Sir Isaac Newton.","Newton addresses planetary perturbations by stating that the greatest power of a planet to disturb the motion of another planet is proportional to the difference in the forces of gravity between the two planets and the planet being disturbed. He specifically calculates"]}
